## Description

look into searxng again; we already implemented the "default" approach documented here https://docs.openwebui.com/tutorials/web-search/searxng/ but i want to explore the differences between native tool and mcp
## Implementation Plan

1. Review current searxng implementation
2. Compare native tool vs MCP approach
3. Document pros/cons of each approach
4. Make recommendation for production use


## Implementation Notes

Already have default implementation, need to explore native tool vs MCP differences
