Want: backlog.md open on specific port, interactive w MCP

## Description

tasks mcp server
we use backlog.md in our case but base the functionality of the mcp server on the supercamp "task creation" tool; should not be too complex
can also draw minimal inspiration from linear.app mcp server and other ticket mgmt systems
## Implementation Plan

1. Review supercamp task creation tool
2. Implement MCP server for backlog.md
3. Add minimal features from linear.app MCP
4. Create task management workflows


## Implementation Notes

Base on supercamp task creation, use backlog.md as storage
