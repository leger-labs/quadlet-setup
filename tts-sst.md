you were correct in identifying my old (legacy, already deprecated, included for posterity) sst quadlet versus my work in progress current whisper quadlet.

stopped you as you were modifying the chezmoi yaml tmpl because i realized that the harbor implementation is interesting.

i can indeed incorporate text to speech as well, but not in the same way that they did. so i am including some reference material 
edge tts is a good enough first impldmentation. prepare the appropriate templated folder for that as well, in the same style as the other quadlet configirations provided from my dotfiles

lastly, say a few words how harbor's speaches exposes ports for health checks and such, as this is also desired in my own. but i m not sure of whether to add it because i do not want to add too much complexity here

configuring things from the single source of truth chezmoi yaml tmpl is ideal also, so make sure we are compliant with this.
