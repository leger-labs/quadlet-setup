## Description

jupyter notebook locally to run python scripts etc see in docs https://tersesystems.com/blog/2025/03/10/jupyter-with-openwebui-code-interpreter/ (there is a mention of litellm in there); for the following we must decide if jupyter should be native or containerized. some relevant articles: https://gist.github.com/wsargent/d72cd6846f952f42a76c3b33962c993a

## Implementation Plan

1. Evaluate native vs containerized Jupyter
2. Set up with OpenWebUI code interpreter
3. Configure litellm integration
4. Test Python script execution


## Implementation Notes

Need to decide on native vs containerized approach - see referenced articles for context
