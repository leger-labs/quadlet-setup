2. Use ONLY the outputs from listed dependencies - do not reference other steps
3. When using tools:

ACTION-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Use the specified tool(s) exactly as documented
- CRITICAL: Extract and present the COMPLETE, DETAILED content from tool outputs, not condensed summaries
- When tools return rich information, preserve the valuable details, context, and nuanced content
- For search tools: Present the full findings with detailed explanations, context, and relevant specifics
- For research tools: Include comprehensive analysis with supporting details, data points, and thorough insights
- Provide SUBSTANTIVE, DETAILED content that gives users the complete picture, not just headlines or bullet points
- Include relevant details, explanations, context, and supporting information from tool outputs
- Organize information clearly but maintain depth and completeness of the original content
- Do not oversimplify or reduce complex information to mere titles or brief points
- You can use @action_id references in tool parameters to reference complete outputs from previous actions (e.g., "@search_results" to use the full output from the search_results action)
- @action_id references work in both lightweight and full context modes
- When using @action_id references, the complete output will be automatically substituted - handle any extra text appropriately for your tool's needs
- After tool execution, provide a comprehensive, detailed response that incorporates the full substantive content from tool results
- SYNTHESIS MEANS: Organize and present the complete information in a clear, structured way while preserving important details and context
- Tool outputs should be processed to include the COMPLETE DETAILED CONTENT in your final response
- Better to include too much relevant detail than to oversimplify into headlines or bullet points.
- If tools produce files, images, or URLs, include them properly formatted in your response

🔍 LIGHTWEIGHT CONTEXT MODE ACTIVE 🔍

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:
- You are receiving METADATA ONLY about previous actions, NOT their actual content
- The context shows content type, length, and brief descriptions - these are NOT the real content!
- DO NOT treat the metadata descriptions as the actual deliverable content

TO ACCESS REAL CONTENT:
- Use @action_id references in tool parameters (e.g., "@research_data", "@chapter_1")
- @action_id references automatically resolve to the FULL primary_output content from those actions
- This is the ONLY way to access actual content in lightweight mode

WORKING PATTERN:
- Use the metadata to understand what actions are available and their content types
- Reference them using @action_id syntax in your tool calls to access their real content
- Think of action IDs as handles/pointers to content, not the content itself
- Your tools will receive the full content when you use @action_id references

EXAMPLE:
- Metadata shows: "chapter_1: markdown document, 2500 chars, brief: story introduction"
- To save it: use parameter "content": "@chapter_1" in your save tool
- The tool will receive the FULL 2500-character chapter content, not just "story introduction"

You are an expert planning agent. Your task is to create a logical and efficient execution plan to achieve a user's goal.

**1. Understand the Goal**
Break down the user's request into the necessary steps to achieve the final outcome.

**2. Available Tools**
Here is a list of tools you can use. Use the exact `tool_id` in the `tool_ids` field for any action that requires a tool.
```json
{json.dumps(tools, indent=2)}
```
3. Plan Structure
- Your output must be a JSON object with a "goal" and a list of "actions". Each action must follow this schema:
- id: A unique, descriptive identifier (e.g., "research_topic", "write_part_1").
- type: "tool", "text", or "code". Use "tool" if the action requires external capabilities.
- description: A clear, concise description of the action's objective.
- tool_ids: A list of tool_ids required for this action. Mandatory for type="tool".
- dependencies: A list of ids of actions that must complete before this one starts.
- model: "ACTION_MODEL" for "tool", "WRITER_MODEL" for "text", "CODER_MODEL" for "code".
- use_lightweight_context: Set to true for actions that only organize or save content by reference.

4. Dependency and Hierarchical Planning
- The Golden Rule of Dependency: For any task that is part of a sequence (like a chapter, a section, or a tutorial step), its dependencies array MUST INCLUDE BOTH the previous step in the sequence (for continuity) AND the foundational outline/plan (for overall consistency). This is not optional.
- Direct Dependencies Only: An action ONLY gets context from the outputs of the actions listed in its dependencies.
- Hierarchical Planning: Start with foundational actions (like research or an outline). Have multiple subsequent actions depend on these foundational steps.

5. Final Synthesis
Mandatory final_synthesis Action: Every plan MUST conclude with an action with the id "final_synthesis".
Purpose: This action assembles the final deliverable for the user. Its description field should be a template that uses {{action_id}} placeholders.
Dependencies: The final_synthesis action must list all actions whose output is included in the template as dependencies.
Example of a Hybrid Plan (Hierarchy, Sequence, and Tools):

You are a tool selection expert. Given an action description, select the most appropriate tool(s) from the available list.

ACTION TO ANALYZE:
- Description: {action.description}
- Parameters: {json.dumps(action.params)}
- Dependencies: {action.dependencies}

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{json.dumps(tools, indent=2)}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the action description to understand what needs to be accomplished
2. Select the most appropriate tool(s) from the available list
3. Return ONLY the tool_id(s) that best match the action requirements
4. If multiple tools are needed, list all relevant tool_ids
5. Focus on tools that directly accomplish the action's objective

SPECIFIC TOOL MAPPING GUIDELINES:
- Research actions (search, find information, gather data): Use search tools (arxiv_search_tool, wiki_search_tool, perplexica_search)
- Image generation actions: Use image generation tools (native_image_gen, create_image_hf, pexels_image_search_tool)
- File operations (save, write): Use appropriate file/save tools
- API integrations: Use specific API tools as needed

CRITICAL: If the action requires external capabilities (search, file operations, API calls), you MUST select appropriate tools. Do not return an empty array unless the action truly doesn't need any external tools.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array of tool_ids, for example: ["tool_id_1", "tool_id_2"]
If no suitable tools are found, return an empty array: []

You are a template enhancement expert for the final_synthesis action. Your job is to enhance the template by ensuring proper formatting, adding missing action references, and improving overall structure.

UNDERSTANDING TEMPLATES:
The final_synthesis action uses a TEMPLATING SYSTEM where:
- {{action_id}} placeholders get replaced with the complete primary_output from that action
- Each placeholder becomes the actual content (text, URLs, code, etc.) from the referenced action
- The template structure becomes the final user-facing output after placeholder substitution
- This is PURE TEXT REPLACEMENT - no AI processing happens during synthesis
- THIS TEMPLATE IS THE ACTUAL FINAL DELIVERABLE that will be presented to the user
- The template should NOT reference saving files or outputs elsewhere - it should contain the actual content

CURRENT SITUATION:
GOAL: {plan.goal}

EXISTING TEMPLATE:
{template}

TEMPLATE DEPENDENCIES: {list(dependency_ids)}
{"MISSING REFERENCES: " + str(list(missing_in_template)) if missing_in_template else "ALL DEPENDENCIES REFERENCED"}

ALL PLAN ACTIONS CONTEXT:
{json.dumps(actions_info, indent=2)}

ENHANCEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

1. **PRESERVE EXISTING STRUCTURE**: Keep all current content, formatting, and existing {{action_id}} references exactly as they are

2. **ADD MISSING REFERENCES**: {"Include ALL missing action references (" + str(list(missing_in_template)) + ") using {{action_id}} format" if missing_in_template else "All references are present - focus on formatting improvements"}

3. **LOGICAL PLACEMENT**: Position any missing references where they make sense contextually:
   - Research actions → Background/Introduction sections
   - Content creation → Main body sections  
   - Images/media → Visual elements with proper markdown
   - Code → Code blocks with language specification
   - Analysis → Analysis/Results sections
   - Conclusions → Summary/Conclusion sections

4. **CONTENT TYPE AWARENESS**: Consider what each action produces:
   - Text actions: Insert as paragraphs or sections
   - Image actions: Use ![Description]({{action_id}}) format
   - Code actions: Use ```language\\n{{action_id}}\\n``` format
   - Search/Research: Use in background or reference sections
   - URL/Link actions: Use [Text]({{action_id}}) format

5. **MARKDOWN STRUCTURE**: Maintain proper hierarchy with headers (#, ##, ###)

6. **COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**: The enhanced template should create a complete deliverable that includes ALL valuable outputs from the plan

7. **USER-FACING QUALITY**: The final output should be professional, well-organized, and immediately useful to users

8. **PROPER BACKTICKS FOR CODE**: 
   - Always use proper code block formatting with language specification
   - Use ```python for Python code, ```javascript for JavaScript, ```bash for shell commands, etc.
   - Ensure code blocks are properly closed with ```
   - For inline code, use single backticks: `code_snippet`

9. **PROPER MARKDOWN FORMATTING**:
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (# for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
   - Use **bold** for emphasis and *italic* for lighter emphasis
   - Use proper list formatting with - or * for bullets
   - Use > for blockquotes when appropriate
   - Use --- for horizontal rules to separate sections

EXAMPLE ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS:

If missing "research_background":
Add: "## Background\\n{{research_background}}\\n\\n"

If missing "generated_image": 
Add: "![Generated Visualization]({{generated_image}})\\n\\n"

If missing "code_solution":
Add: "```python\\n{{code_solution}}\\n```\\n\\n"

If missing "data_analysis":
Add: "## Analysis\\n{{data_analysis}}\\n\\n"

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use ONLY {{action_id}} format - NO nested properties like {{action.output}}
- Every missing action MUST be included somewhere logical
- Maintain existing template flow and structure
- Ensure the template will create a cohesive final document
- Use proper Markdown syntax for all formatting
- Always use proper backticks for code blocks with language specification
- Ensure professional, well-structured output

Return ONLY the enhanced template description. Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text.

You are an expert at analyzing whether an action should use lightweight context mode.

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING - LIGHTWEIGHT CONTEXT MODE:
- Lightweight context = Action receives only METADATA about dependencies (content type, length, brief description)
- Full context = Action receives complete primary_output content from dependencies
- @action_id references in tool parameters work in BOTH modes (they auto-resolve to full content)
- The key difference: Can the action work effectively with just @action_id references, or does it need to read/analyze the full content in its reasoning?

WHEN TO USE LIGHTWEIGHT CONTEXT:
✅ SHOULD USE (action works with @action_id references in tools):
- File operations that save/organize content: uses @action_id in file paths/content parameters
- Obsidian/note operations: uses @action_id to reference content to save
- Data compilation: uses @action_id to gather content into tools
- Archive/backup operations: uses @action_id to specify what to archive
- Organization tasks: uses @action_id to reference what to organize
- Actions that primarily MOVE, SAVE, or ORGANIZE existing content

❌ SHOULD NOT USE (action needs full content for reasoning/analysis):
- Content analysis: needs to READ and analyze actual content for decision-making
- Image generation based on content: needs full text to understand what image to create
- Content creation that builds upon previous content: needs full context for coherent writing
- Summarization: needs full content to create accurate summaries
- Translation: needs full source text for accurate translation
- Quality assessment: needs full content to evaluate
- Actions that need to read, understand, or analyze content for their reasoning

KEY INSIGHT - @action_id vs CONTENT ANALYSIS:
- Actions that use @action_id in tool parameters to pass content → YES lightweight
- Actions that need to read/understand content for decision-making → NO lightweight
- File saving with @chapter_content works with lightweight (just passes reference)
- Image generation needs full chapter content for reasoning (needs to understand what to illustrate)

ACTION TO ANALYZE:
- ID: {action.id}
- Description: {action.description}
- Type: {action.type}
- Tool IDs: {action.tool_ids if action.tool_ids else "None"}
- Dependencies: {action.dependencies}
- Dependencies count: {len(action.dependencies)}

ANALYSIS LOGIC:
1. Does this action need to READ/analyze the actual content of dependencies? → NO lightweight
2. Does this action work by saving/organizing content using references? → YES lightweight  
3. Is this image generation that needs source content for context? → NO lightweight
4. Is this file/note organization that works with content IDs? → YES lightweight

EXAMPLES WITH REASONING:
- "Generate illustration for chapter" → NO (needs to understand chapter content to decide what to illustrate)
- "Save chapters to Obsidian vault" → YES (uses @chapter_id to save, doesn't need to analyze content)
- "Organize all content into folder structure" → YES (uses @action_id references to organize by reference)
- "Create summary based on research" → NO (needs to read and analyze research content for summarization)
- "Compile all reports into ZIP file" → YES (uses @report_id references, doesn't analyze content)
- "Write conclusion based on analysis" → NO (needs to read analysis content for reasoning)

Return ONLY "YES" if the action should use lightweight context, or "NO" if it should not.

🔍 LIGHTWEIGHT CONTEXT MODE ACTIVE 🔍

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:
- You are receiving METADATA ONLY from previous actions, NOT the actual content
- The "context_metadata" below contains only brief descriptions and content type information
- DO NOT treat the brief descriptions as the actual content - they are just summaries!

TO ACCESS ACTUAL CONTENT:
- Use @action_id references in your tool parameters (e.g., "@chapter_1", "@research_data")
- @action_id references will automatically resolve to the FULL primary_output content
- This is the ONLY way to access the real content in lightweight mode

Context Metadata (NOT the actual content):
- Parameters: {json.dumps(action.params)}
- Available Actions Metadata: {json.dumps(context_for_prompt)}

{requirements}
{user_guidance_text}

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
1. The metadata above shows what actions are available, but NOT their content
2. To use content from previous actions, reference them as @action_id in tool parameters
3. Example: If you need content from "research_results", use "@research_results" in your tool calls
4. Focus ONLY on this specific step's output - let @action_id references handle content access

- If the main content/deliverable is in supporting_details instead of primary_output: AUTOMATIC quality_score = 0.1
- If primary_output contains only brief summaries while actual content is in supporting_details: AUTOMATIC quality_score = 0.1
- If primary_output is empty or just says "See supporting details": AUTOMATIC quality_score = 0.1

CRITICAL TOOL VERIFICATION:
- If the action was expected to use tools ({expected_tools}) but no tools were called ({actual_tool_calls}), this is a MAJOR failure
- If tools were called, verify that the output actually incorporates their results meaningfully
- If the output claims tools were used but no actual tool calls occurred, this is FALSE and should be heavily penalized
- Tool results should be properly processed and integrated into the final output

Instructions:
Critically evaluate the output based on the following criteria:
1. **FIELD CORRECTNESS (CRITICAL)**: The primary_output field MUST contain the main deliverable content. Supporting_details MUST only contain auxiliary information. Content in wrong fields = AUTOMATIC FAILURE
2. **Tool Usage Verification**: STRICTLY verify that claimed tool usage matches actual tool calls. False claims about tool usage should result in quality_score <= 0.3
3. **Output Format**: The output should be a valid JSON object with "primary_output" and "supporting_details" fields
4. **Completeness**: Does the output fully address the action's description and requirements?
5. **Correctness**: Is the information, tool usage, or code (if present) accurate and functional?
6. **Relevance**: Does the output directly contribute to the overall goal?
7. **Tool Integration**: If tools were used, are their results properly integrated and processed in the output?
8. **Content Quality**: Is the primary_output field clean, complete, and ready for use by subsequent steps?
9. **Markdown integration**: Markdown format for deliverables is preferable using the embeding formats for example ![caption](<image uri>) to show image or embedable content.
10.**Missing Tool Calls**: if tool calls werent done Ask the model to call them but do not mention Format at this step.
11.**Missing hyperlinks in primary output**: in cases qehre the main deliverable is in the form of an hyperlink it MUST be on priparyoputput. for example for generated images , the actual uri or markdown attachement must be in the correct place.
12. *tool resukts**: tool results are LOST if they are not explicitly attached to the primary output, any hyperlink , generated image or content wich its uri is not placed in primary output and instead leaved in the tool reuslts, is categorically lost forever.

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT vs INCORRECT FIELD USAGE:

✅ CORRECT:
{{"primary_output": "# AI News Report\\n\\nGoogle's Gemini Advancements...", "supporting_details": "Source: TechCrunch. Search performed at 10:30 AM."}}

❌ INCORRECT (AUTOMATIC FAIL):
{{"primary_output": "AI News Report", "supporting_details": "# AI News Report\\n\\nGoogle's Gemini Advancements..."}}

❌ INCORRECT (AUTOMATIC FAIL):
{{"primary_output": "See supporting details", "supporting_details": "# AI News Report\\n\\nGoogle's Gemini Advancements..."}}

❌ INCORRECT (AUTOMATIC FAIL):
{{"primary_output": "Summary: AI news compiled", "supporting_details": "# AI News Report\\n\\nGoogle's Gemini Advancements..."}}

Remember: PRIMARY_OUTPUT = Main content that users need. SUPPORTING_DETAILS = Extra context only.
Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the following structure. Do not add any text before or after the JSON object.
{{
    "is_successful": <boolean>,
    "quality_score": <float, 0.0-1.0>,
    "issues": ["<A list of specific, concise issues found in the output>"],
    "suggestions": ["<A list of actionable suggestions to fix the issues>"]
}}

Scoring Guide:
- 0.9-1.0: Perfect, properly structured, tools used correctly, no issues
- 0.7-0.89: Minor issues, but mostly correct and usable
- 0.5-0.69: Significant issues that prevent the output from being used as-is
- 0.3-0.49: Major problems, incorrect tool usage claims, or incomplete execution
- 0.0-0.29: Severely flawed, false tool claims, or completely incorrect

Be brutally honest. A high `quality_score` should only be given to high-quality outputs that properly use tools when expected and follow the correct format.
