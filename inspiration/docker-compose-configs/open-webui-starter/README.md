## 👷 Project Overview

The Open WebUI Starter project is an entry point into using the open-source project Open WebUI. The goal is to simplify setup and configuration. Open WebUI integrates with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and provides a private, user-friendly, and local interface for interacting with computer intelligence.
