this is an important tool that we can use to prepare presentations
Description
- presentation builder slidev on brand generated deployed on cloudflare with text in git

aim is to use
https://github.com/presenton/presenton
https://docs.presenton.ai/

the presenton oss project does exactly what we were trying to achieve here
specifically through its MCP implementation

and add theme that can cover leger labs, agency, or other themes
priority to agency

## advanced implementation:

conceptually we want to create a single workflow that lets me place a .md file formatted in a specific way
this product should sequentially:
1) turn the page into a cloudflare pages page and assign a temporary url to it
    note: pictures that would be included here are instead uploaded to cloudflare images
2) provision a cloudflare access login form to it that asks the user to input their email - this is to record all the times a person viewed the page

### wrapping it up

this project should become a post on reddit, personal webpage and reddit
