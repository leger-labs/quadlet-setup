This would be the fallback to cloudflare mcp out of the box; see notes below:
## Description

puppetteering browser locally if cloudflare browser is not working for some reason: https://github.com/browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase specifically also investigate https://github.com/harlan-zw/mdream as part of a local alternative to cloudflare browser mcp (for "ripping" contents) as it is used in a dedicated docker container
## Implementation Plan

1. Set up browserbase MCP server as fallback
2. Investigate mdream for content extraction
3. Configure dedicated Docker container
4. Create fallback logic from Cloudflare browser


## Implementation Notes

This is a fallback option if Cloudflare browser MCP doesn't work
